    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<h3> General Information </h3>
<p>I am going to expand on last weeks story. Assignment 2 includes a little more complex ways to console.log code, and therefore is more suitable for the complexities of aquiring a job.</p>
<p>Once again, I am an Excavation Contractor. Which means that I dig and drill pipes and other things underground. This story is a meet-up with one of my supervisors and will more accurately portray the complexities of quoting larger jobs.</p>
